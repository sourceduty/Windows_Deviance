> Software concept for measuring changes made by users to the defaults of Microsoft Windows.

#

Analyze each Windows file and setting deviation. Find deviations by comparing default Windows files and settings to customized Windows files and settings. 

### Concept Notes

- Findng customizations for Microsoft Windows system deviation.
- Microsoft Windows system deviation rating.

### Windows Deviance

The concept revolves around a software tool designed to monitor and measure changes made by users to the default settings and files of Microsoft Windows. This tool works by analyzing each file and setting within the Windows system, identifying any deviations from the original, factory-set defaults. By comparing these default configurations to the customized versions created by the user, the software can detect and document any alterations, providing a detailed overview of system modifications.

The primary feature of this tool is its ability to locate and catalog all customizations made to the Windows operating system. This includes changes to system files, registry entries, and user-specific settings. The software would offer users a clear understanding of how their system has been altered, which could be useful for troubleshooting, system optimization, or simply for keeping track of customizations over time.

A key advantage of this software would be its capability to provide insights into the stability and security of the Windows system. By identifying deviations from the default settings, the software could help users recognize potentially harmful changes or unnecessary customizations that might affect system performance or security. This makes the tool valuable for both casual users and IT professionals who need to maintain system integrity.

Future updates to the software could introduce a Windows system deviation rating feature. This rating would quantify the extent of customization, offering a numerical value or percentage that reflects how far the current system deviates from its original state. Such a rating could be useful for users wanting to know the impact of their changes or for administrators who need to enforce standardized configurations across multiple systems.

Overall, this software concept aims to empower users by providing transparency and control over their Windows environment. By making it easy to detect, analyze, and understand system changes, the tool would enhance the user experience, improve system management, and potentially increase the security and performance of Windows systems.
